## 💎 Tier Classification Logic

| Annual Spend | Tier     |
|--------------|----------|
| < 5000       | Silver   |
| 5000–9999    | Gold     |
| ≥ 10000      | Platinum |

Tier is auto-computed on every create/update based on `annualSpend`.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Unit and controller tests cover:

- CRUD operations
- Tier calculation
- Email format validation

To run tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

---

## 💾 H2 Database Console

Access via:  
[http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)

**Settings:**
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- Username: `sa`
- Password: *(leave blank)*

## 📌 Assumptions

- `email` and `name` are treated as unique identifiers for lookup.
- No pagination or filtering logic for multi-customer listing (kept simple).
- No authentication or authorization added.
- All customer data is stored in-memory using H2 and reset on restart.
